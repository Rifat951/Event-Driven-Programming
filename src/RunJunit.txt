Since our program is based on default package, in order to run Junit we had to declare the Junit in default package (which is of course a bad practice)
P.S. Junit4 was used for this assignment

1. we tried to dsiplay how junit works. However, further improvements are required
2. It would be better if we got some hands on expreience with Junit.
